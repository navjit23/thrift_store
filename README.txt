Hi, I am Navjit Singh
I study Full Stack Web Development in Red River College, Winnipeg

This is my final project for my Web Development-2 Course
I designed a php website (CMS) which is based on a Thrift Store
The database is backed by phpMyAdmin

All the data has been made up and would describe the products that would be used in a real life working webpage
